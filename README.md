FrameGUI (frame-gooey) is a free, very easy to use encoding utility featuring AI filters, based on the more comprehensive [EncodeGUI](https://github.com/DaGooseYT/EncodeGUI) encoding tool.

This repository only consists of the source code; no builds are hosted here. See https://encodegui.com/downloads.html for the latest builds.

# Features
Below is a list of key features in FrameGUI:
- Supports nearly any video as an input.
- Extreamly lightweight with a total installation size of only 240MB.
- Advanced job queue with status indicators and an advanced control set.
- Decluttered encoding settings layout allows you to start processes in as little as a few clicks.
- Features RIFE v4.6 AI frame interpolation as the Convert FPS function.
- Features SRMD super resolution AI upscaling.
- AI filters can be used with ALL major GPU vendors: NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL (Intel iGPUs are not supported). 
- Features VapourSynth API for ALL included filters **which doesn't extract frames before rendering, allowing a faster render time than nearly all competing software.**
